## Description
In this project, we will utilize Python to analyze data from bike-sharing systems in three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Our task involves writing code to import the data and generate descriptive statistics to answer various questions. Additionally, we will develop a script that processes user input to create an interactive terminal-based experience for presenting these statistics.
